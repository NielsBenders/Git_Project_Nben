## What is this?

This repository was made specifically for me to revisit for refreshing my memory on using git.
It does not contain any usefull data, but it's nice reference material for later.
Feel free to use the repository and the included word documents, however I doubt you could find a use for it.
But if you do feel like the material provided is good enough to maybe even learn from it, be my guest.
